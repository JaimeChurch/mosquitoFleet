            <h1>Auto Ferries: A New System Emerges</h1>
            <p class="leftPara1">
                The growing number of automobiles and their
                increasing importance as the transportation
                mode of choice led to a reworking of Puget
                Sound's marine transportation system.
                Throughout the 1920s, the operators of the
                Mosquito Fleet faced the challenge of
                providing new types of vessels and docking
                facilities. No longer was it practical or
                necessary for boats to stop at every small
                community. Automobiles led to roads and the
                roads made it possible for passengers to drive
                to more centralized ferry landings.

                alt="Picture the Port Gamble shine ferry.">
            <p class="rightPara4">
                The multi-stop passenger services which had been
                the bastion of small steamboat operators were no
                longer required and routes were consolidated.
                Coupled with the expense of converting existing
                ferried into auto ferries and the investment
                required for new vessels, many of the
                transportation companies fell by the wayside,
                leaving a smaller roster of highly competitive
                groups to struggle for supremacy on the Sound's
                waterways.
