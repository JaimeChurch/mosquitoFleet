            <h2 class="leftH2"> Black Ball Line: Dominance on the Water</h2>
            <p class="leftPara1">
                Out of a handful of transportation companies, two were worthy opponents:
                the Kitsap County Transportation Company and the Puget Sound Navigation
                Company. By the 1930s, they had each successfully absorbed a number of
                other companies servicing the same routes. In the turmoil of the Great
                Depression and the labor movements spawned by economic necessity,
                one company emerged as the major ferry transportation company. Puget
                Sound Navigation, or the Black Ball Line, achieved dominance in 1936 and
                maintained a virtually unchallenged position until the State of Washington
                took over in 1951.

                Kitsap County Transportation Company: The White Collar Line
            </h2>
            <p class="rightPara1">

                Kitsap County Transportation Company, one of the two competing powers on Puget
                Sound, stemmed from Warren Gazzam's consolidation of the pioneer steamboating
                companies operating in the North Kitsap area. Starting in 1905, KCTC eventually
                acquired or eliminated from business the Moe Brothers, Hanson Transportation
                Company, the Liberty Bay Company, and the Poulsbo Transportation Company.
                Colonel Gazzam as he was known in Kitsap County, was one of the most bitter rivals
                of Puget Sound Navigation's Joshua Green. Between 1903 and 1923, the Black Ball
                Line (Puget Sound Navigation) and The White Collar Line (Kitsap Country
                Transportation Company) competed ruthlessly. Green's company, enhanced by
                former Great Lakes steamers, had the bigger vessels. Gazzam relied on smaller and
                faster vessels and on technological innovation. The first diesel-powered passenger
                vessel, Gazzam's 92-foot Suquamish launched in 1914, was an example of
                one-upmanship.
