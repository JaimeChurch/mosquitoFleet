            <p class="leftPara1">
                The arrangement enjoyed by the two remaining
                lines was upset by the Great Depression of the
                1930s which caused the same economic
                downturn in the Northwest as it did in the rest
                of the country. It was fertile ground for union
                organizing and ferry workers eagerly signed up
                in the hope of attaining the level of wages that
                prevailed on San Francisco Bay ferries.

                In November of 1935 the ferry-based unions struck
                Kitsap County Transportation Company. Knowing it
                would ruin the opposition; Captain Peabody of the
                Black Ball Line tried to avert the strike, and
                ultimately offered to share any windfall to PSN from
                increased revenue during the strike. The White Collar
                Line responded with an offer to sell-out. By that time
                Black Ball had also been hit by strikes and most
                service on Puget Sound was halted by a thirty-three
                day work stoppage. Black Ball weathered the strike
                and was able to acquire Kitsap County
                Transportation Company by agreeing to assume
                $140,000 in liabilities.
