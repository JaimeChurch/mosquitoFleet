            <h1>The Mosquito Fleet: Mass Transit of Early Kistap County</h1>

            <p class="leftPara1">
                Along the various shorelines of Kitsap County, one can see
                remnants of what were once docks. Solitary pilings, abandoned
                and decaying, mark the places where a fleet of small vessels,
                fondly remembered as the Mosquito Fleet, stopped to pick up
                passengers - transporting people and their goods between the
                bustling and growing metropolises of Seattle and Tacoma and
                the smaller, more rural, communities that dotted the Puget
                Sound.

            <p class="rightParaHome">
                Communities with picturesque names like Suquamish,
                Indianola, and Olalla were less isolated then. They had direct
                links to Seattle. By stopping at every waterfront community
                where there was a dock or a float, the fleet supplemented the
                larger steam-powered sternwheelers and sidewheelers. Some
                of the boats were even able to beach themselves in order to
                load passengers and freight. Eventually, the smaller, agile
                vessels became the mainstay of sound transportation and
                remained so until the demand for auto carriers led to the
                next stage in ferryboats in the 1920s.

            <p class="leftPara2">
                Mosquito Fleet vessels are often recalled as "jaunty," trim," or
                "smart." They were, in reality, practical. By transporting
                passengers, mail, livestock, and freight from just about any
                shoreside community that could build a dock or place a float
                where the vessels could stop, the boats played a direct role in
                the development of Puget Sound towns. Places that could not
                have existed in the isolation of the heavy forests and absence
                of roads prospered because they were linked to bigger
                metropolises. Their link, the Mosquito Fleet, used the water
                highways provided by nature.

                The original, if unofficial "fleet" was made up mostly of
                sidewheelers and sternwheelers, while the boats of the late
                period were propeller driven steam ships. Size was not a
                classifying factor since boats varied from 30 feet to more
                than 200 feet in length. Most measured on the average of
                100 feet and carried around 300 passengers. Using the
                broad definition, the number of Mosquito Fleet vessels has
                been estimated at 2,500 boats. At the turn of the century,
                the steamers were serving approximately 25 routes on the
                sound.
