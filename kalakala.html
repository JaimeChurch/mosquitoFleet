            <p class="leftPara1">
                Designed as a futuristic, streamlined vessel,
                the Kalakala was launched in 1935 on the
                Seattle-Bremerton run. Boasting 97.75%
                steel construction, she appeared sleek but
                a ride on the Kalakala was anything but
                smooth.

                <br><br><br>
                By 1967, burning 300,000 gallons of fuel every
                7 days of operation, she became too expensive
                to maintain and her run ended. She was sold
                for use as an Alaskan seafood processing
                plant. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                In 1985, Seattle sculptor Peter Bevis noticed
                the Kalakala while on a fishing trip. He began
                work to return the vessel to Puget Sound. In
                1991, he founded the Kalakala Foundation
                and raised funds for her return.

                He purchased the vessel in 1998 and had her
                towed back to Washington. He continued
                fundraising efforts to restore the vessel, but
                was ultimately unsuccessful. She was
                scrapped in 2015.
