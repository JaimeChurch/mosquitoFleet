            <h1>The Mary F Perley</h1>
            <p class="leftPara1">
                Mary F. Perley, built at Samish in 1888, never served
                Brownsville but she unwittingly and mysteriously
                ender her days there. The 104-foot sternwheeler
                made an unscheduled stop at Brownsville in the
                dark of night in 1901 with no one aboard.
                The vessel had burned at Alki Point dock in Seattle and was
                awaiting repair or disposition. Could the steamer have drifted
                all that distance, unnoticed, in a single night? It would have
                been a big job for a tug, especially at night, and no tug owner
                claimed to have done it. Were there ghostly forces at work?
                Did this ship have a mind of its own? Perhaps it was seeking a
                remote hideaway from the ship breaker salvagers...

                The Mary F. Perley was never claimed by
                anybody. Today she is buried beneath a
                landfill and road bed at the south end of
                the Brownsville bridge. The mystery is
                buried with her.
